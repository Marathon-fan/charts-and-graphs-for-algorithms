Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure. 
--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==

The inorder traversal sequence of a BST is an increasing sequence, in which we will switch two nodes.

1) Originally, the sequence may look like this:

2) if the switched numbers are adjacent, then the sequence becomes this:

3) if the switched numbers are not adjacent, then the sequence becomes this:

Consequently, if we are able to find the reversed pairs(there might be one or two pairs, depending on whether the switched nodes are adjacent in the inorder sequence), we will find the answer.
